        "### The pattern is very clear: the more you lower the required probability to put a certain in the class \"1\" category, more records will be put in that bucket.\n",
        "#### This implies an increase in recall (we want all the \"1\"s), but at the same time, a decrease in precision (we misclassify many of the other class).\n",
        "### Therefore, even though recall is our goal metric (do not miss a fraud transaction), we also want to keep the model being accurate as a whole.\n",
        "- There is an option I think could be quite interesting to tackle this. We could assing cost to misclassifications, but being interested in classifying \"1s\" correctly, the cost for misclassifying \"1s\" should be bigger than \"0\" misclassifications. After that, the algorithm would select the threshold which minimises the total cost. A drawback I see is that we have to manually select the weight of each cost... therefore, I will leave this know as a thought.\n",
        "- Going back to the threshold changing, there is an option which is the Precisio-Recall curve. By visually seeing the performance of the model depending on the threshold we choose, we can investigate a sweet spot where recall is high enough whilst keeping a high precision value.\n",
